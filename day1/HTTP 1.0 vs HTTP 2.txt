Difference between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP2 :-

1) Request and Response methods:
HTTP 1.1 keeps all the request and responses in plain text while HTTP 2 keeps request and responses in Binary encapsulated format while still maintaining HTTP semantics like verb, methods and Headers.

2) Multiplexing:
HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource. HTTP/2 does this by splitting data into binary-code messages and numbering these messages so that the client knows which stream each binary message belongs to.

3)Header Compressions:
Small files load more quickly than large ones. To speed up web performance, both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller. However, HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets. This eliminates a few bytes from every HTTP packet. Given the volume of HTTP packets involved in loading even a single webpage, those bytes add up quickly, resulting in faster loading.

4)Priortization:
HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.HTTP/2 offers a feature called weighted prioritization. This allows developers to decide which page resources will load first, every time. In HTTP/2, when a client makes a request for a webpage, the server sends several streams of data to the client at once, instead of sending one thing after another.Developers can assign each of these data streams a different weighted value, and the value tells the client which data stream to render first.
