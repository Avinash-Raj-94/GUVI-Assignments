                    <p class="para1">There's more visual freedom in parallax website design. Rather than focusing on block style<br>
                        information architecture, you can create refreshing and engaging visuals such as animations or beautiful<br>
                        photography, that act as a continuum, ultimately inspiring users to scroll further down the page.</p>

                    <p class="para4">Mobile and tablets have evolved te way we engage in websites. It's now less about clicking and more about scrolling, swiping and tapping. Long-scrolling websites take away the barrier of complex navigation, 
                        providing a responsive, user-friendly experience for mobile users.</p>

         <p class="para6">These days, scrolling is so simple that it's become an instinctive action, whereas clicking through 
             to another page requires thought and motivation. A single page website allows users to identify their purpose on the 
             website quicker, than needing to sift through multiple pages.

         <p class="para7">Instead of hitting back button, users must scroll back up the page which can be frustrating for users who want to refer back to a certain element.
              An easy way around this is to include top navigation and have each element anchored to a category or selection.</p>
